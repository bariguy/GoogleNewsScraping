# GoogleNewsScraping

Just  playing around with BeautifulSoup on Google News

1. Created a function that returns link, title, news agency, date&time of a news slot with searchinng for "Corona" in Google News

2. Created a function that returns the same attributes, but instead the search_word is set as input()
